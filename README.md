# FSM-finite-state-machine-editor
A graphical tool for editing FSMs. 
Can generate a code (actually for Qt environement only, using CodeGen library).

<description of the FSM editor coming soon...>

There is a demo-project TestFSM, where a part of code (directory handlers/*) is generated by FSMEditor.

The TestFSM project is the prototype of the touch-screen terminal software.

The prototype is implemented using Qt/Qml and finite-state machines (FSM). It consists of two applications, main application and central system simulator, supplemented with two libraries.

The main application created with Qt-Creator's "Qt Quick control application" template includes a GUI implemented in Qml and two FSMs running each in its own thread: "main" and "communication".

The main thread is responsible for general activities. The communication thread is responsible for maintaining the connection and message exchange with the central system (here simulated, see HostSim project). Further functionality extention is possible by adding more FSM-threads: i.e. to maintain payment (self-service terminals), scanning, printing tasks, etc.

The libraries implement a logging system and auxiliary utilities

to be continued...
